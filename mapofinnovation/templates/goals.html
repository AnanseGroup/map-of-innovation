			<p>We’re building a dynamic and collaborative platform to keep an up-to-date database of all likeminded community innovation spaces, and to encourage more networking and linkages amongst these spaces worldwide. We’ve standardized a set of datafields and built a backend structure (API) in conjunction with Rob Baker’s Maker.json, so all data hosted on the Atlas can be easily shared across other sites. Rather than creating yet another whole new map of innovation spaces, we’re focusing on the underlying information interchange and architecture. (In fact, we’ve got a running list of 50+ different lists of innovation spaces that we’re gradually incorporating into this Atlas.) To paraphrase Jonathan Robinson from <a href="http://open.co">Open.co</a>, think of how different airlines have come up with a unified standard (that is, an API or Application Programming Interface) for sharing their information across flight-finding websites like Kayak; we’re developing similar information-sharing standards for various platforms of innovation spaces.</p>
			<p>We’re in the process of turning this platform into an open-access wiki, to keep everything up-to-date through crowdsourced submissions and moderators. Please keep in mind that there are likely a number of errors in the information about spaces, as we have sourced this from a number of different databases which may be user-generated and outdated. When you catch mistakes or omissions, kindly let us know!</p>
