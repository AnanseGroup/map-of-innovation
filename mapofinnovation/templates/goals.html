	<p>With your help, this dynamic and collaborative Atlas will keep an up-to-date database of all the community innovation spaces, and hopefully encourage more networking and linkages amongst these spaces worldwide. We’re making a map and public wiki for anyone to add new spaces and correct information about existing spaces.</p>
			<p>On the back-end, we’re standardizing a set of tags and other datafields and building a data structure (API or Application Programming Interface) in conjunction with Rob Baker’s Maker.json, so all data hosted on this Atlas can be easily shared across other sites. Just as uniformly-sized shipping containers make it easier to ship goods around the world, APIs establish a uniform standard for sharing information around the internet– so anyone can take this open-source Atlas (or some subset of the Atlas) for their own websites and platforms.</p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that there are likely a number of errors in the information about spaces, as we’ve gathered data from a bunch of different databases-- many of which are user-generated and outdated. When you catch mistakes or omissions, kindly let us know.</p>
